        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>Born and raised in Guatemala City, he holds a Computer Science degree from Universidad del Valle de Guatemala. He started his professional career as a software engineer in charge of building commercial software solutions, such as database driven web and mobile applications. Then he joined the Center for Health Studies at Universidad del Valle de Guatemala where he lead the development of a questionnaire-based data collection system for mobile devices. He participated in the design and development of a data management system for collecting and merging data from questionnaires and laboratory results to build and distribute datasets ready for statistical analysis, right out of the box.</p>
        <p>He acquired experience in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to support logistics and field activities for research operations, and Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) systems to capture human-marked data in paper forms. He is co-author to a few peer-reviewed health-related publications, and has been acknowledged for his contributions to several others.</p>
        <p>Working closely with epidemiologists, physicians, molecular biologists, statisticians and other kind of scientists allowed him to learn basic concepts of these fields. This led him to identify oportunities for automating processes that were repetitive, error-prone and complex but still performed by researchers themselves, precisely the kind of problem where computers are good at. His work helped to reduce the error introduced in the data by the human factor, thus improving the quality of the results and conclusions of the investigations.</p>
        <p>However, he noticed that usually these high-quality-science results and conclusions are not effectively communicate back to the communities where the variables are measured and the data produced. This situation aroused his current interest: finding appropriate ways to present information to the public so that this information is relevant, interesting and applicable to the day-to-day activities at the individual, familiar and community levels, causing a positive impact on human development, especially among the most vulnerable.</p>
